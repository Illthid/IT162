 <h2 class="pageID">Welcome</h2>


 <p>Hello, My name is David. I am working on my degree in database development.
    I have been in and out of computers since I was young.Over the last 20 years
    I've been building my own computers. I am 37 years old. One thing about me
    is I'm a nerd. A common saying of mine is ‘If it's nerdy I have probably
    done it’. I play tabletop role playing games. I’ve been to lots of
    conventions. I also ride motorcycles and go to the gym 3 to 4 days a week.
    I play lots of video games, mostly open world rpgs but love a good strategy
    when I can find one.I was in the automotive industry for many years.
    I can fix most things on a car, I've a love for 1950-1976 Volkswagens.
    I also do my own work on my motorcycles. I am always looking for new people
    to hang out with. My roommates and I have 2 wonderful cats, Raistlin and
    Caraman. We call them race and car… haha.</p>
